                    A few years back, I suddenly got an interest in learning HTML and CSS. However, due to many reasons, I wasn't able to go much further. I had to quit on the mid-path!<br>Past is Past! Now I want to change the present for a better future, and with a new zeal and aspiration, I have restarted learning HTML and CSS not only because of my attraction towards them but for the sole purpose of becoming a web developer shortly, In shaa Allaah.
